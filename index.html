    <p>Hello, my name is Scott Ladd. I’m from Syracuse, New York originally, but I have been living in Atlanta since I was 13 years old. I have an older brother and sister, both of whom are married. I’ve been married since 2014 to my wonderful wife and best friend, Mallory. We have 4 dogs and 3 cats between us. Never a dull moment at our house!</p>
    <p>Before my career as web developer began, I was a double ASE Master Automobile/Heavy Duty Truck technician, and then a Kohler generator technician. Most of my time was spent on the computer, whether it was looking up diagnostic information, using diagnostic software or just doing paperwork. I realized that was the part of the day I enjoyed the most so here I am.</p>
